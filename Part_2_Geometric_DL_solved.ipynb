    "### Separating Radial and Angular Components\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve precise representations of molecular data, spherical networks consider functions defined in 3D space with separate **radial** and **angular** components. The **radial part** requires high precision to accurately represent distances between atoms, while the **angular part** captures the orientations and directions of atomic interactions. By treating these components separately, spherical networks can model complex molecular interactions more effectively.\n",

    "### Spherical Harmonics as Fourier Basis on a Sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spherical harmonics** serve as the Fourier basis functions on a sphere and are fundamental in representing the angular component of functions in 3D space. They allow us to decompose complex angular dependencies into a series of functions with varying degrees $ l $, each corresponding to different levels of detail and symmetry properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Degrees $ l $**: Represent different levels of angular frequency, with higher degrees capturing more complex angular variations.\n",
    "- **Orders $ m $**: Range from $-l$ to $+l$ and represent different orientations for a given degree.\n",

    "### Irreducible Representations (Irreps) of Different Degrees\n",

    "1. **0-Degree Irreps (Scalars)**: Invariant under rotation, representing features that do not change with orientation.\n",
    "2. **1-Degree Irreps (Vectors)**: Transform linearly under rotations, representing directional features.\n",
    "3. **Higher-Degree Irreps**: Degrees $ l = 2, 3, \\ldots $ correspond to more complex features (e.g., tensors) that capture higher-order geometric information and transform predictably under rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Passing in Spherical Networks\n",

    "#### 4. Message Computation\n",
