However, molecular structures often exhibit complex geometric relationships that cannot be fully captured by vectors alone. **Spherical networks** address this limitation by utilizing representations capable of expressing **higher-degree features**. These higher-degree features can capture intricate spatial patterns and symmetries essential for accurately modeling molecular interactions.\n",
